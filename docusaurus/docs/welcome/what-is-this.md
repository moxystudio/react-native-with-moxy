This project is [MOXY's](https://moxy.studio/) boilerplate to accelerate the setup of new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/) applications.

## Motivation

To create a React Native mobile app from ground up and lift a walking skeleton to production it is necessary to take several actions to put all pieces together. This is why we developed this boilerplate and comprehensive documentation to guide you through the process. The boilerplate ships with many features and it's built on industry best practices & standards.

To start with our stack, we introduce you [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/).

## React Native

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is an open-source mobile application development framework. It allows to develop applications for Android, iOS, Windows and other platforms by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities although the focus of this boilerplate will be, for now, Android and iOS.

This boilerplate was scaffolded with React Native's CLI which means we are not coupled to any framework built on top of React Native resulting on a more versatile setup since we have the power to make whatever changes necessary to native code and configurations.

If you wish to learn more about React Native, we recommend taking a look at [their documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).
