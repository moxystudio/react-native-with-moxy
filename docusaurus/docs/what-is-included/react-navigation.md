We are using [**React Navigation**](https://reactnavigation.org/) as our default routing and navigation solution.

**React Navigation** is one of the most widely adopted and actively maintained libraries out there. It is also one of the solutions recommended by the React Native core team.

The boilerplate ships with the [React Navigation 5.x](https://reactnavigation.org/blog/2020/02/06/react-navigation-5.0) which is the latest major version released.

If you wish to learn more about **React Navigation**, we encourage you to take a look at [their documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started).
