For testing, this boilerplate is configured to use [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/) and [**Enzyme**](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme), providing strong options for testing varied types of code.

You can find more details about our implementation of Jest in its configuration file, `jest.config.js`, which uses our own [`@moxy/jest-config`](https://github.com/moxystudio/jest-config).
